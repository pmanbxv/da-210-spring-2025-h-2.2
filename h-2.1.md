# DA 210 -- Spring 2025 -- Homework 2.1 -- Professor Lavin

## Directions 

1. These questions will _mostly_ focus on tabular data and Pandas, which will likely include new material, as well as some review and deepening of CS-11x.
2. Don't forget to add your name above. You can edit the markdown by double-clicking on the cell. 
3. Save your work often and commit your changes using git/Github Desktop.
4. When you are finished, save your work, convert the Jupytext Notebook to .html format, and submit the HTML file on Canvas.
5. When you have completed homework 2.1 - 2.4, push your updated repo to Github.com.

__Reminders:__ 

- You are not permitted to get the answers from a classmate or to use Github Copilot, chatGPT, etc. on this homework. These exercises are for practice so, if you use outside help in a way that's not permitted, you are only cheating yourself out of a chance to learn and prepare for future quizzes and tests. 
- Working with an ARC tutor and visiting our TA's office hours are both permitted, but they should be provide advice and support, and you should not expect them to do your work for you. 


## Question 1

Copy/paste the following code block to the code cell below and make sure it runs without error:

```
import pandas as pd 

# load sample csv
df_gss_sample = pd.read_csv('data/gss_sample.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='utf8') 

# load rows counts of full data
gss_full_row_counts = pd.read_csv('data/gss_full_row_counts.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='utf8')

# load years per variable data
gss_years_per_var = pd.read_csv('meta/gss_data_years_per_var.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='utf8')

# load data dictionary
gss_data_dictionary =  pd.read_csv('meta/gss_data_dictionary.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='latin1')

```

Print the `dtype` of the following variables:

- `df_gss_sample['sex']` 
- `df_gss_sample['hrs1']`
- `df_gss_sample['happy']`
- `df_gss_sample['sibs']`
- `gss_data_dictionary['variable']`
- `gss_data_dictionary['var_doc_label']`
- `gss_data_dictionary['missing']`

__Note:__ The need for 'utf8' and 'latin1' parameters may vary by operating system. If you have errors, try loading each csv in separate blocks, and omit `encoding` argument as needed. 

```python
# load csvs below here
import pandas as pd

# load sample csv
df_gss_sample = pd.read_csv('data/gss_sample.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='utf8')

# load rows counts of full data
gss_full_row_counts = pd.read_csv('data/gss_full_row_counts.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='utf8')

# load years per variable data
gss_years_per_var = pd.read_csv('meta/gss_data_years_per_var.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='utf8')

# load data dictionary
gss_data_dictionary = pd.read_csv('meta/gss_data_dictionary.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='latin1')

# print dtypes below here 
print("df_gss_sample['sex']       :", df_gss_sample['sex'].dtype)
print("df_gss_sample['hrs1']      :", df_gss_sample['hrs1'].dtype)
print("df_gss_sample['happy']     :", df_gss_sample['happy'].dtype)
print("df_gss_sample['sibs']      :", df_gss_sample['sibs'].dtype)
print("gss_data_dictionary['variable']      :", gss_data_dictionary['variable'].dtype)
print("gss_data_dictionary['var_doc_label'] :", gss_data_dictionary['var_doc_label'].dtype)
print("gss_data_dictionary['missing']       :", gss_data_dictionary['missing'].dtype)
```

In the markdown cell below, fill in the markdown table address whether each datatypes is appropriate for the variable it contains and why.


---

## Question 2

In the code cell below manipulate the `gss_years_per_var` DataFrame by dropping the `year` column and renaming the `year_main` column to `year`. Save the result as a new variable called `gss_years_per_var_renamed` and, finally, print the dtype of the new `year` column.

```python
gss_years_per_var_renamed = gss_years_per_var.drop(columns='year').rename(columns={'year_main': 'year'})
print(gss_years_per_var_renamed['year'].dtype)
```

## Question 3

We can get the sum of every `True` value for every column in `gss_years_per_var` using some code that looks like this: 

```
year_sums = pd.DataFrame(gss_years_per_var.sum())

```

Write some code below that uses the `loc` method to get the name of every variable that has a `True` value for all 34 year represented in the dataset (1972-2022). Make sure you print your result. 

```python
year_sums = pd.DataFrame(gss_years_per_var.sum())

full_vars = year_sums.loc[year_sums[0] == 34]

print(full_vars)
print("\nVariables that are True for all 34 years:")
print(full_vars.index.tolist())
```

---

## Question 4

In the markdown cell below, use information from our metadata files and the GSS website to answer the following questions:

1. What is the purpose of the GSS? How did it originate? How is it conducted, and who participates? What kinds of questions are on the survey, and how have the questions have changed over time?
2. What are the `occ`, `occ10`, `occ80` variables, and why do we have three different variables representing soemthing so similar? Why does `occ10` have more coverage than `occ` and `occ80`? 
3. What is the `wtssps` variable, and what does it represent?

__Hint__: to explore GSS variables, you can look at the variable names, the 'var_doc_label' column in `gss_data_dictionary` and the GSS Data Explorer at https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/.


| Question| Your Response |
|---|---|
| Question 1 | The General Social Survey (GSS) was launched in 1972 by NORC at the University of Chicago to track and better understand trends in opinions, attitudes, and behaviors among U.S. adults. It is conducted through interviews with nationally representative samples and covers topics from demographics and social issues to politics and religion. Over time, new questions have been introduced to capture emerging topics, while core questions remain to enable long-term trend analysis.|
| `occ` variables |occ: Typically refers to the main occupation code used in earlier GSS datasets (and often corresponds to an older census classification). occ80: Uses the 1980-based Census occupation classification scheme. occ10: Uses the 2010-based Census occupation classification scheme.To allow researchers to compare occupations across time, the GSS sometimes back codes older data into newer classification systems, or vice versa. This creates multiple parallel variables.|
| `wtssps` variable |The wtssps variable is one of several sampling weights provided by the GSS. In general, a weight variable helps to adjust the sample so it better represents the overall U.S. population by correcting for, over or under sampling of certain groups, potential biases in response rates, demographic distributions|
